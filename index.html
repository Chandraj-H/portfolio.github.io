          <div>
            <h4 class="text-xl font-bold">Music Recommendations</h4>
            <p><strong>Current:</strong> Matrix Factorization, Word2Vec</p>
            <p><strong>Proposed:</strong> BERT4Rec, SASRec</p>
            <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Use transformers for personalized sequential modeling.</p>
            <p><strong>Justification:</strong> Switching to BERT4Rec and SASRec allows better modeling of sequential user behavior, improving personalized recommendations.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div>
            <h4 class="text-xl font-bold">Search</h4>
            <p><strong>Current:</strong> TF-IDF / BM25</p>
            <p><strong>Proposed:</strong> Hybrid with SBERT</p>
            <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Better for fuzzy NLP-rich queries.</p>
            <p><strong>Justification:</strong> Combining BM25 with SBERT improves search relevancy for more complex queries with ambiguous or nuanced language.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div>
            <h4 class="text-xl font-bold">Streaming Bitrate Optimization</h4>
            <p><strong>Current:</strong> Greedy ABR (HLS/DASH)</p>
            <p><strong>Proposed:</strong> Reinforcement Learning-based ABR (Pensieve)</p>
            <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> For mobile-heavy and emerging markets, RL ABR can vastly improve QoE, but requires cost-benefit analysis due to complexity.</p>
            <p><strong>Justification:</strong> Reinforcement learning-based bitrate adaptation provides smoother playback by better handling fluctuating networks, but it comes with a higher implementation cost.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div>
            <h4 class="text-xl font-bold">Ad Targeting</h4>
            <p><strong>Current:</strong> Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDT) / Random Forests</p>
            <p><strong>Proposed:</strong> Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)</p>
            <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> GBDTs remain efficient; GNNs are best suited for modeling cross-user interactions or group behavior.</p>
            <p><strong>Justification:</strong> GNNs capture social and sequential relationships more effectively, but GBDTs are still efficient for simpler ad targeting tasks.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div>
            <h4 class="text-xl font-bold">Caching</h4>
            <p><strong>Current:</strong> LRU Cache (Redis)</p>
            <p><strong>Proposed:</strong> TinyLFU / ARC</p>
            <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Upgrade backend caches to TinyLFU for song/artist/album metadata where hit rate is critical.</p>
            <p><strong>Justification:</strong> TinyLFU and ARC offer better hit rates by balancing recency and frequency, making them more efficient for metadata-heavy services.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div>
            <h4 class="text-xl font-bold">Audio Fingerprinting</h4>
            <p><strong>Current:</strong> SimHash (locality-sensitive hashing)</p>
            <p><strong>Proposed:</strong> Learned Audio Embeddings (e.g., CLAP, OpenL3, SimCLR on spectrograms)</p>
            <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> For advanced copyright/cover detection, embedding-based models are superior, but SimHash remains unbeatable for speed.</p>
            <p><strong>Justification:</strong> Learned embeddings handle more complex scenarios such as remixes and covers, while SimHash is still the fastest for basic content matching.</p>
